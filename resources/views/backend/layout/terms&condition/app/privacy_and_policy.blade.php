    <p>We may use cookies and other technologies, such as web beacons, web storage, and unique advertising identifiers,
        to collect information about your activity, browser, and device. We may also use these technologies to collect
        information when you interact with services offered through third parties, such as advertising and commerce

    <p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually remove or reject browser
        cookies through the settings on your browser or device. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies
        could affect the availability and functionality of our services.</p>
    <p>Here are the reasons we may use cookies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Analytics.</span> This type of cookies shows us which pages users view, which links are
            popular, etc. These cookies only provide anonymized information that does not identify anybody personally.
            This information is then bundled with the similar information from the other users, so that we can analyze
            the general usage patterns.
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Essential cookies.</span> These are necessary to provide the services that you have asked
            for. Without these essential cookies, our Site would not be able to operate. They are necessary to enable
            users to navigate through the Site and use its main features. E.g., essential cookies identify registered
            users so that they can access member-only areas of the site. Essential cookies keep users logged in. If a
            subscriber disables essential cookies, that subscriber won’t be able to get to all of the content that a
            subscription entitles them to. These cookies don't collect information that could be utilized for the
            purposes of marketing or figuring out what places on the internet you have visited.
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">To show relevant advertising.</span> If we allow ads on our Site, they can contain
            cookies in order to provide ads most relevant to your interests. They can also help limit the number of
            times you see a particular ad and to assess the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">To improve your browsing experience.</span> This type of cookies enables the site to
            remember users’ preferences and settings, such as geographic region or language. They can also be used to
            restrict the number of times an ad is shown, to remember which forms you have already filled in, so that you
            don’t have to do it again.
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">To implement tracking technology on our Site.</span> This tracking does not use your
            personal information; it uses deidentified data (i.e., data that cannot be tied specifically to you). We
            will not combine this data with your other personal information without your prior express permission.
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">To implement flash cookies.</span> Those are local stored objects that collect and store
            information about your preferences and navigation on our Site. Flash cookies are not managed by the same
            browser settings as are used for browser cookies.
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">To implement web beacons.</span> Pages of our the Site and our emails may contain small
            electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs. pixel tags and single-pixel gifs)
            that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other
            related statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain content and verifying system
            integrity).
        </li>
        <li><span class="bold">To implement pixel tracking.</span> It is a process that involves the use of invisible
            pixel tags that consist of a few lines of computer code. Pixel tracking measures the effectiveness of
            advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. For example, if you visit our Site from
            an advertisement on another Site, the pixel tag will allow the advertiser to track that its advertisement
            brought you to our Site. If you visit our Site, and we link you to another website, we may also be able to
            determine that you were sent to and/or transacted with a third-party website. This data is collected for use
            in our marketing and research.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There is a way to turn off cookies by going to your browser’s Help or Settings menu. However, keep in mind that
        disabling cookies may limit your use of the Service and/or delay or affect the way in which it operates.</p>
